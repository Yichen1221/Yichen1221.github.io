# Homework 4: Hypothesis testing - Solution

## Question 1

A researcher hypothesises that years of schooling, $S$, may be related to the number of siblings (brothers and sisters), $SIBLINGS$, according to the relationship

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
    S=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}SIBLINGS+u
\end{equation*}
```
She is prepared to test the null hypothesis $H_0:\beta_{2}=0$ against the alternative hypothesis $H_1:\beta_{2}\neq 0$ at the 5% and 1% levels. She has a sample of 60 observations.

The critical t values at the 5% and 1% significance level are 2.00 and 2.66 respectively. Undertake hypothesis tests for the following scenarios:

1.  $\hat{\beta}_{2}=-0.20$, s.e.$(\hat{\beta}_{2})=0.07$

2.  $\hat{\beta}_{2}=-0.12$, s.e.$(\hat{\beta}_{2})=0.07$

3.  $\hat{\beta}_{2}=0.06$, s.e.$(\hat{\beta}_{2})=0.07$

4.  $\hat{\beta}_{2}=0.20$, s.e.$(\hat{\beta}_{2})=0.07$

`r hide("I need a hint")`

To test whether any of the coefficients provided above are statistically significant, we need to follow these steps:

1.  State the null and alternative hypotheses

2.  Select the significance level

3.  Select and calculate the test statistics

4.  Set the decision rule

5.  Make statistical decisions

`r unhide()`

Now we look at this question.

Step 1. We know the null hypothesis is $H_0:\beta_{2}$=`r fitb(0)` and alternative hypothesis is $H_1:\beta_{2}\neq$ `r fitb(0)`.

Step 2. The significance levels are `r fitb(5)` % and `r fitb(1)` %.

Step 3: calculate the t-values, which measure how many standard errors is our coefficient away from zero.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
    t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})}
\end{equation*}
```
Step 4: The decision rule is: If the absolute value of t-value is `r mcq(c("smaller",  answer = "greater"))` than the critical value, then we `r mcq(c("cannot",  answer = "can"))` reject the null Hypothesis and our coefficient is statistically significant.

Please note:

-   Our test is two-tailed, so the non-rejection area has a left boundary of -2.00 at the 5% significance level and -2.66 at the 1% significance level. The right boundary is +2.00 for 5% and +2.66 for 1% significance level.

    ![](images/5reject.png){width="200"}

    ![](images/1reject.png){width="200"}

-   Looking at the critical values shows that to reject the null Hypothesis at a lower significance level, the t-value has to be greater than for a higher significance level! Therefore the non-rejection area at the 1% significance level is wider than at the 5% significance level.

-   If you can reject the $H_0$ at the 1% significance level, you can always reject it also at the 5% significance level, but if you can reject it at the 5% level does not mean that you can also reject it at the 1% significance level!

-   To get full points in the coursework, ensure that you complete the 5 steps of Hypothesis testing.

Step 5: Make decisions

`r hide("Click here to see the solution")`

Step 1. We know the null hypothesis is $H_0:\beta_{2}=0$ and alternative hypothesis is $H_1:\beta_{2}\neq 0$.

Step 2. The significance levels are 5% and 1%.

Step 4: The decision rule is: If the absolute value of t-value is greater than the critical value, then we can reject the null Hypothesis and our coefficient is statistically significant.

<br>

Now we calculate the t-values in step 3 and undertake hypothesis tests for the following scenarios:

1.  $\hat{\beta}_{2}=-0.20$, s.e.$(\hat{\beta}_{2})=0.07$

Null hypothesis: $H_0:\beta_{2} = 0$; Alternative hypothesis: $H_1:\beta_{2}\neq 0$

$t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})} \approx$ `r fitb(-2.857)` (Fill in with three decimal places)

At the 1% level, the left critical value is `r fitb(-2.66)` (Fill in with two decimal places), so t-value falls into the left `r mcq(c(answer = "reject", "non-rejection"))` area, therefore we `r mcq(c("cannot reject",  answer = "reject"))` $H_0$ at the 1% level.

Because we `r mcq(c("cannot reject",  answer = "reject"))` it at the 1% level, we already know that we can also `r mcq(c("cannot reject",  answer = "reject"))` it at the 5% level.

`r hide("Click here to see the solution")` $t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})} \approx -2.857$

At the 1% level, the left critical value is -2.66, so t-value falls into the left reject area, therefore we reject $H_0$ at the 1% level.

Because we reject it at the 1% level, we already know that we can also reject it at the 5% level. `r unhide()`

<br>

2.  $\hat{\beta}_{2}=-0.12$, s.e.$(\hat{\beta}_{2})=0.07$

Null hypothesis: $H_0:\beta_{2} = 0$; Alternative hypothesis: $H_1:\beta_{2}\neq 0$

$t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})} \approx$ `r fitb(-1.714)` (Fill in with three decimal places)

At the 5% level, this t-value falls within `r mcq(c("reject", answer = "non-rejection"))` area, therefore we `r mcq(c(answer = "cannot reject",  "reject"))` $H_0$ at the 5 % level.

As we `r mcq(c(answer = "cannot reject",  "reject"))` $H_0$ at the 5% level, we already know that we also cannot reject it at the 1% level!

`r hide("Click here to see the solution")` $t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})} \approx -1.714$

At the 5% level, this t-value falls within non-rejection area, therefore we cannot reject $H_0$ at the 5% level.

As we cannot reject $H_0$ at the 5% level, we already know that we also cannot reject it at the 1% level! `r unhide()` <br>

3.  $\hat{\beta}_{2}=0.06$, s.e.$(\hat{\beta}_{2})=0.07$

Null hypothesis: $H_0:\beta_{2} = 0$; Alternative hypothesis: $H_1:\beta_{2}\neq 0$

$t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})} \approx$ `r fitb(0.857)` (Fill in with three decimal places)

At the 5% level, t-value falls within `r mcq(c("reject", answer = "non-rejection"))` area, therefore we `r mcq(c(answer = "cannot reject",  "reject"))` $H_0$ at the 5% level.

As we `r mcq(c(answer = "cannot reject",  "reject"))` $H_0$ at the 5% level, we already know that we also cannot reject it at the 1% level!

`r hide("Click here to see the solution")` $t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})} \approx 0.857$

At the 5% level, t-value falls within non-rejection area, therefore we cannot reject $H_0$ at the 5% level.

As we cannot reject $H_0$ at the 5% level, we already know that we also cannot reject it at the 1% level! `r unhide()` <br>

4.  $\hat{\beta}_{2}=0.20$, s.e.$(\hat{\beta}_{2})=0.07$

Null hypothesis: $H_0:\beta_{2} = 0$; Alternative hypothesis: $H_1:\beta_{2}\neq 0$

$t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})} \approx$ `r fitb(2.857)` (Fill in with three decimal places)

At the 1% level,the right critical value is `r fitb(2.66)` (Fill in with two decimal places), so t-value falls within `r mcq(c(answer = "reject",  "non-rejection"))` area, therefore we `r mcq(c("cannot reject", answer = "reject"))` $H_0$ at the 1 % level.

Because we `r mcq(c("cannot reject",  answer = "reject"))` it at the 1 % level, we already know that we can also `r mcq(c("cannot reject",  answer = "reject"))` it at the 5% level.

`r hide("Click here to see the solution")` $t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})} \approx 2.857$

At the 1% level,the right critical value is 2.66, so t-value falls within reject area, therefore we reject $H_0$ at the 1% level.

Because we reject it at the 1% level, we already know that we can also reject it at the 5% level. `r unhide()` <br>

## Question 2

The number of cigarettes smoked per day is regressed on the price of cigarettes per pack in USD. Sample size $n=807$.

![](images/regressionoutput3.png){width="600"}

1.  Interpret the intercept and the coefficient of the independent variable.

-   Interpretation of the price of cigarettes coefficient: `r fitb(1.00000)` USD price increase would decrease the number of cigarettes smoked by `r fitb(0.03297)` (Fill in with five decimal places).

-   Interpretation of the constant: If the cigarette price per pack was `r fitb(0.00000)`, then individuals would smoke on average `r fitb(10.67457)` (Fill in with five decimal places) cigarettes.

`r hide("Click here to see the solution")` - Interpretation of the price of cigarettes coefficient: 1 USD price increase would decrease the number of cigarettes smoked by 0.03297.

-   Interpretation of the constant: If the cigarette price per pack was 0, then individuals would smoke on average 10.67457 cigarettes. `r unhide()`

<br>

2.  Write down the test hypotheses for testing the significance of the intercept and coefficient.

$H_0:\beta_{1}=$`r fitb(0)`, $H_1:\beta_{1}\neq$ `r fitb(0)`

$H_0:\beta_{2}=$`r fitb(0)`, $H_1:\beta_{2}\neq$ `r fitb(0)`

`r hide("Click here to see the solution")` $H_0:\beta_{1}=0$, $H_1:\beta_{1}\neq 0$

$H_0:\beta_{2}=0$, $H_1:\beta_{2}\neq 0$ `r unhide()` <br>

3.  Calculate t-statistics for the intercept and the coefficient of cigarette prices. The critical t-value at the 5% significance level is 1.96.

-   Intercept: $t-value = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{1}-\beta_{1}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{1})} \approx$ `r fitb(1.729)`(Fill in with three decimal places) \< $t_{crit,5\%}= 1.96$

We cannot reject $H_0$. The intercept is statistically `r mcq(c(answer = "insignificant",  "significant"))`.

-   Cigprice: $t-value = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})} \approx$ `r fitb(-0.323)`(Fill in with three decimal places) \> $t_{crit,5\%}=-1.96$

We cannot reject $H_0$. The coefficient of cigarette price is statistically `r mcq(c(answer = "insignificant",  "significant"))`.

`r hide("Click here to see the solution")` 
-   Intercept: $t-value = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{1}-\beta_{1}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{1})}=\approx 1.729$ \< $t_{crit,5\%}= 1.96$

We cannot reject $H_0$. The intercept is statistically insignificant.

-   Cigprice: $t-value = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})} \approx -0.323$ \> $t_{crit,5\%}=-1.96$

We cannot reject $H_0$. The coefficient of cigarette price is statistically insignificant. `r unhide()` <br>

## Question 3

Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the intercept as well as the coefficient of cigarette prices using the R output in Question 2.

![](images/regressionoutput1.png){width="600"}

The formula for calculating the confidence interval for the intercept is \begin{equation*}
    \hat{\beta}_{1}-s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{1}) \times t_{crit,5\%} \leq \beta_{1} \leq  \hat{\beta}_{1}+s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{1}) \times t_{crit,5\%}
\end{equation*}

The regression output shows that the point estimate $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ is `r fitb(10.67457)` (Fill in with five decimal places) and its standard error $s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{1})$ is `r fitb(6.17296)` (Fill in with five decimal places).

The formula for calculating the confidence interval for the cigarette coefficient is

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{\beta}_{2}-s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2}) \times t_{crit,5\%} \leq \beta_{2} \leq  \hat{\beta}_{2}+s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2}) \times t_{crit,5\%}
\end{equation*}
```
The regression output shows that the point estimate $\hat{\beta_{2}}$ is `r fitb(-0.03297)` (Fill in with five decimal places) and its standard error $s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})$ is `r fitb(0.10206)` (Fill in with five decimal places).

`r hide("Click here to see the solution")`

The regression output shows that the point estimate $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ is 10.67457 and its standard error $s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{1})$ is 6.17296.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
    10.67457-6.17296 \times 1.96 \leq \beta_{1} \leq 10.67457+6.17296 \times 1.96
\end{equation*}
```
The regression output shows that the point estimate $\hat{\beta_{2}}$ is -0.03297 and its standard error $s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})$ is 0.10206.

\begin{equation*}
    -0.03297-0.10206 \times 1.96 \leq \beta_{2} \leq -0.03297+ 0.10206 \times 1.96
\end{equation*}

## Question 4

Calculate the F statistic for the regression undertaken in Question 2 using $ESS$ and $RSS$ presented in the R anova output table above. Check that the F statistic derived from $R^2$ is the same. Perform the F test, whereby the critical F-value at the 5% significance level is approximately 3.8415.

The formula for the F-statistics are \begin{equation*}
    F(1,805)=\frac{ESS/(k-1)}{RSS/(n-k)}
\end{equation*}

or

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
    F(1,805)=\frac{R^2/(k-1)}{(1-R^2)/(n-k)}
\end{equation*}
```
The regression output is

![](images/regressionoutput1-01.png){width="600"}

and

![](images/variancetable.png){width="400"}

We follow hypothesis testing five steps:

Step 1: the null hypothesis is $H_0:R^2=0$ and alternative hypothesis is $H_1:R^2\neq 0$.

Step 2: the significance level is 5%.

Step 3: calculate the F-values using either formula

$ESS=$`r fitb(20)` (Fill in with integer)

$RSS=$`r fitb(151734)` (Fill in with integer)

$k=$`r fitb(2)` (Fill in with integer)

$n=$`r fitb(807)` (Fill in with integer)

$R^2=$`r fitb(0.0001296)` (Fill in with seven decimal places)

$F(1,805)=\frac{ESS/(k-1)}{RSS/(n-k)} \approx$ `r fitb(0.106)` (Fill in with three decimal places)

$F(1,805)=\frac{R^2/(k-1)}{(1-R^2)/(n-k)} \approx$ `r fitb(0.104)` (Fill in with three decimal places)

Step 4: The decision rule is: If the F-value is greater than the $F_{crit,5\%}$ then we can reject the null Hypothesis, so our model is statistically `r mcq(c("insignificant", answer = "significant"))`.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
    F(1,805) \approx 0.104 < F_{crit,5\%}=3.8415
\end{equation*}
```
Step 5: Make decisions

Therefore we cannot reject the $H_0$ and our model is statistically `r mcq(c(answer = "insignificant",  "significant"))`.

`r hide("Click here to see the solution")` 

Step 3: calculate the F-values using either formula

$ESS=20$

$RSS=151734$

$k=2$

$n=807$

$R^2=0.0001296$

$F(1,805)=\frac{ESS/(k-1)}{RSS/(n-k)} \approx 0.106$

$F(1,805)=\frac{R^2/(k-1)}{(1-R^2)/(n-k)} \approx 0.104$

Step 4: The decision rule is: If the F-value is greater than the $F_{crit,5\%}$ then we can reject the null Hypothesis, so our model is statistically significant.

Step 5: Make decisions Therefore we cannot reject the $H_0$ and our model is statistically insignificant.
