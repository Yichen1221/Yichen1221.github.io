# R Workshop 1 - Introduction to R

In this computer lab we will have to achieve the following tasks/learning outcomes:

-   import data and view the data

-   label the variables

-   create new variable

-   sort the data

<br>

# Preparing your workspace

Before you do each task, you need to prepare your workspace first.

**Step 1**. Create a folder called RWorkshop1

**Step 2**. Go to Blackboard -- Week 2 folder -- R Workshop 1, download datafile: **`crime.xls`**, **save it in the RWorkshop1 folder you created in step 1**

**Step 3**. Open Rstudio and set working directory

Menu bar → Click Session → Set Working Directory → Choose Directory → Select RWorkshop1 folder you created in step 1

**Step 4.** Create an R script

!! If you forget how to prepare your workspace, please review **R Workshop 0** first.

<br>

## **For each task, replace the missing part XXXX to make these codes work.**

<br>

# Task 1. Import the Excel data set into R.

The native data format of R is **`.Rdata`**, however, you can also open other formats, such as .xlsx, .csv, etc. Non-native data formats have to be imported rather than just opened. Before we can import Excel spreadsheets directly into R, we have to activate a R-library first.

-   You can use the package window (that's the window with the yellow border in Figure 1) and tick the box next to the package name.

![Figure 1](images/libraryreadxl.jpg){width="700"}

<br>

-   Or you type the following command into the R script and click Run

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide',eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
```

This line loads the necessary `readxl` library.

<br>

After you activate the `readxl` library, there are two ways to import data:

**Option 1**. Use codes

We import the data set with the `read_excel()` function and store this dataset as an object with the name `crime`.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,results='hide',eval=FALSE}
crime <- XXXX("crime.xls")
```

<br>
**Option 2**. Use menu bar

Menu bar → Click File → Import Dataset → From Excel

Don't forget to tick the "First Row as Names" box if it is unticked!

<br>

# Task 2. View the data set in R's data viewer.

To open the data viewer, type in the following command:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,results='hide',eval=FALSE}
XXXX(crime)
```

The `View()` function allows you to view data in a read-only mode. Keep in mind the capital 'V' as R is case-sensitive; using `view()` will not work.

<br>

# Task 3. Label the variables using the definitions given above.

You have to attach a variable label to each variable. A function called `apply_labels()` could be used to achieve this goal.

`apply_labels()` can facilitate the allocation of lables to variablesis and it is stored in package **`expss`**.

Considering this is the first time for us to use **`expss`**, we need to install package **`expss`** and then activate it using `library()` command.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,results='hide',eval=FALSE}
XXXX("expss")                     #install package expss
XXXX(expss)                       #activate package expss
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,results='hide',eval=FALSE}
crime <- apply_labels(crime,
                      pop = "actual population in number",
                      crimes = "total number of crimes",
                      unem = "unemployment rate (%)",
                      officers = "number of police officers",
                      pcinc = "per capita income, $",
                      area = "land area, square miles",
                      lawexpc = "law enforcement expenditure per capita, $")
```

<br>

# Task 4. Create a new variable which measures the population density for each city.

We know that population density can be calculated using the following formula: \begin{equation*}
population\ density = actual\ population\ / land\ area
\end{equation*}

To generate a new variable population density and add it to the existing `crime` dataset, we use the following command:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,results='hide',eval=FALSE}
crime$popdens <- crime$XXXX / crime$XXXX       #generate a new variable popdens and add it to crime dataset
```

`crime$pop`: \$ doller operator here means we only pick variable `pop` from dataset `crime`

`crime$area`: \$ doller operator here means we only pick variable `area` from dataset `crime`

`crime$popdens`: we create a new variable called `popdens` in dataset `crime`, assign the value of using `crime$pop` divided by `crime$area` to it

<br>

You may wonder why we add `crime$` in front of every variable. The reason is that R can store more than one data frame, matrix, list, vector etc., at the same time, so the prefix `crime$` is necessary to avoid ambiguity.

Think of `crime$` as an address where e.g. the variable `pop` stays. If you have loaded another data frame that contains a `pop` variable, R would know that we only want to use the variable from the `crime` dataset and not from the other data frame. There are library packages that can facilitate the process, however, we will not cover them in this module.

Note that the variable label was copied from the `pop` variable. I recommend to update the label with the method we introduced in Task 3.

<br>

# Task 5. Sort the data with respect to the population density of each city.

Sorting data is a useful action to get a general feeling for the data, e.g. are there any outliers in the dataset? Are there any unusual patterns?

To change the order of the rows in a data frame, we will apply the `order()` command.

We first rank all observations with respect to the population density in `crime` dataset and store this information in a vector called `rank`. The rank vector contains indices that we can use to sort the crime data frame.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide',eval=FALSE}
rank <- XXXX(crime$popdens)
```

We use `rank()` to sort popdens from the smallest to the largest value and assign it to a new created dataset called `crime.popdens1`

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide',eval=FALSE}
crime.popdens1 <- crime[XXXX,]
```

<br>

To sort the data from the largest to the smallest number, we set the order argument decreasing to TRUE, and assign it to an another new created dataset called `crime.popdens2`

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide',eval=FALSE}
crime.popdens2 <- crime[order(crime$popdens, decreasing = XXXX),]
```

We can save some time and space by merging the two steps into one line, however, it is sometimes easier to understand a command if it is split into separate stages.

<br>

# Task 6. What is the minimum and maximum value for population density in the dataset?

The minimum and maximum values can be produced by generating standard descriptive statistics of the variables using `summary()` in R.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide',eval=FALSE}
XXXX(crime$popdens)
```

<br>

# Final comments:

Before you finish, save the dataset. Never overwrite your original data!

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide',eval=FALSE}
save(crime, file = "crime2.Rdata")
```

This command tells R to use the `crime` dataset and save it as 'crime2.Rdata'. Rdata is an R specific format. R can also save data in .csv format, that can be opened with any text editor or spreadsheet software:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide',eval=FALSE}
write.csv(crime, file = "crime2.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

<br>

**Finally, save you R scipt file by clicking disc icon.**

# Quick Exercises

-   To import Excel spreadsheets (.xls) into R, we need to use the function `r mcq(c("read.csv",  "read.table", answer = "read_excel"))` stored in package `r mcq(c("read_excel",  answer = "readxl", "readxls"))`

-   Only pick variable `unem` from dataset `crime`, we use the code `r mcq(c(answer = "crime$unem", "unem", "crime"))`

-   To get standard descriptive statisticss for variable `unem` from dataset `crime`, we use `r mcq(c(answer = "summary", "describe", "get"))` `(crime$unem)`

<br>

# Further Exercises

Now you are ready to answer the following questions on your own:

1.  Find the minimum and maximum number of police officers in the data set.

2.  Create a new variable which measures the crime rate per 1,000 of population.

3.  Is the city with the highest number of police officers also the city with the highest crime density?

4.  How many crimes occurred in the richest city?

5.  Is the richest city also the one with the highest number of police officers?

6.  What is the average unemployment rate across these 46 U.S. cities?

7.  Does the city with the highest unemployment rate also have the highest crime level?
