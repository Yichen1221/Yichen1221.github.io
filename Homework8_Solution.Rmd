# Homework 8: Dummy Variables - Solution

## Question 1

Does the sex of an individual affect educational attainment?

We regress $S$ (educational attainment in years) on $ASVABC$ (Ability score), $SM$ (educational attainment of mother in years), $SF$ (educational attainment of father in years), and $MALE$, a dummy variable that is 1 for male respondents and 0 for female ones. Interpret the coefficients and perform t-tests. The critical t value at the 5% significance level is 1.96. Is there any evidence that the educational attainment of males is different from that of females?

$ASVABC$:

Interpretation: `r fitb(1)` score higher ability score increases educational attainment on average by `r fitb(1.20327)` (Fill in with five decimal places) more years, `r mcq(c(answer = "holding everything else constant", "holding SM constant", "holding SF constant", "holding MALE constant"))`.

$H_0:\beta_{2}=$ `r fitb(0)`; $H_1:\beta_{2}\neq$ `r fitb(0)`

$t-value = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})}\approx$ `r fitb(10.607)` (Fill in with three decimal places) \> $t_{crit,5\%}=1.96$

Therefore we `r mcq(c("cannot", answer = "can"))` reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. The coefficient of ability score is statistically `r mcq(c("insignificant", answer = "significant"))`.

$P\_value$ of $ASVABC$ coefficient is $<$ `r fitb(2e-16)` (Fill in with scientific notation) and it is `r mcq(c(">", answer = "<"))` than 5% significance level, so the coefficient of ability score is statistically `r mcq(c(answer = "significant", "insignificant"))`.

`r hide("Solution")`
Interpretation: 1 score higher ability score increases educational attainment on average by 1.20327 more years, holding everything else constant.

$H_0:\beta_{2}=0$ ; $H_1:\beta_{2}\neq 0$

$t-value = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-\beta_{2}^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{2})}\approx$ 10.607 \> $t_{crit,5\%}=1.96$

Therefore we can reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. The coefficient of ability score is statistically significant.

$P\_value$ of $ASVABC$ coefficient is $<$ 2e-16 and it is < than 5% significance level, so the coefficient of ability score is statistically significant.

$SM$:

Interpretation: One more year of educational attainment of the mother leads on average to 0.17453 years of educational attainment, `r mcq(c(answer = "ceteris paribus", "holding ASVABC constant", "holding SF constant", "holding MALE constant"))`.

$H_0:\beta_{3}=$ `r fitb(0)`; $H_1:\beta_{3}\neq$ `r fitb(0)`

Therefore we `r mcq(c("cannot", answer = "can"))` reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. The coefficient of educational attainment of the mother is statistically `r mcq(c("insignificant", answer = "significant"))`.

$P\_value$ of $SM$ coefficient is 0.000268 and it is `r mcq(c(">", answer = "<"))` than 5% significance level, so the coefficient of educational attainment of the mother is statistically `r mcq(c(answer = "significant", "insignificant"))`.

Therefore we can reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. The coefficient of educational attainment of the father is statistically `r mcq(c("insignificant", answer = "significant"))`.

Summary: The slope coefficients are all significant at the 1 percent level or higher. That for $MALE$ indicates that males tend to have nearly a year less schooling than females, controlling for $ASVABC$ score and parental education. The reason is that although males are now under-represented at the postgraduate level, a relatively recent phenomenon, as well as over-represented among high school drop-outs, a long-standing one.

## Question 2

Does ethnicity affect educational attainment?

We add the following ethnic dummy variables to the regression model above:

|            |                                         |
|:----------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| $ETHHISP$  |       1 if hispanic, 0 otherwise        |
| $ETHBLACK$ |         1 if black, 0 otherwise         |
| $ETHWHITE$ | 1 if not hispanic or black, 0 otherwise |

We regress $S$ on $ASVABC$, $MALE$, $SM$, $SF$, $ETHBLACK$, and $ETHHISP$. In this specification $ETHWHITE$ has been chosen as the reference category, and so it is omitted. Interpret the regression results and perform t tests on the coefficients. The critical t value at the 5% significance level is 1.96.

You have to undertake an F-test:

Step 1. State the null and alternative hypotheses

Null Hypothesis: $H_0: \delta_{b} = \delta_{h} =$ `r fitb(0)`

Alternative Hypothesis: $H_1: \delta_{b} \neq 0 \, or \, \delta_{h} \neq 0 \, or \, both \, \delta_{b} \, and \, \delta_{h} \neq 0$

`r hide("Solution")`
Null Hypothesis: $H_0: \delta_{b} = \delta_{h} = 0$

Step 2. Select the significance level:

Significance level $\alpha=$ `r fitb(5)`$\%$

`r hide("Solution")`
Significance level $\alpha= 5\%$
`r unhide()`

<br>

Step 3. Select and calculate the test statistics: $F(cost\, in\, dof, dof\, remaining) =\dfrac{reduction\, in\, RSS/cost\ in\, dof}{RSS\, remaining/dof\, remaining}=\dfrac{(RSS_1-RSS_2)/cost\ in\, dof}{RSS_2/dof\, remaining}$

$RSS_1=$ `r fitb(2457.21)` (Fill in with two decimal places)

$RSS_2=$ `r fitb(2445.56)` (Fill in with two decimal places)

cost in dof $=$ `r fitb(2)` (Fill in with interger)

dof remaining $n-k=$ `r fitb(493)` (Fill in with interger)

$F(2, 493)=$ `r fitb(1.17)` (Fill in with two decimal places)

`r hide("Solution")`
$RSS_1=2457.21$

$RSS_2=2445.56$

cost in dof $=2$

dof remaining $n-k=500-7=493$ 

$F(2, 493) =\dfrac{(RSS_1-RSS_2)/cost\ in\, dof}{RSS_2/dof\, remaining}=\dfrac{(2457.21-2445.56)/2}{2445.56/493}=1.17$

Step 4. Set the decision rule:

$F_{crit,5\%}(cost\, in\, dof, dof\, remaining)=F_{crit,5\%}(2, 493)=3.01$

<br>

Step 5. Make statistical decisions:

$F=1.17 < F_{crit,5\%}(2, 493)=3.01$

We cannot reject the null $H_0:\delta_{b} = \delta_{h} = 0$.

We conclude that adding two ethnicity dummies `r mcq(c(answer = "does not improve", "improve"))` the overall fit of the model significantly.

## Question 4

Is the effect of the $ASVABC$ score on educational attainment different for males and females? We define a slope dummy variable $MALEASVC$ as the product of $MALE$ and $ASVABC$:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
    MALEASVC = MALE\times ASVABC
\end{equation*}
```
Regress $S$ on $ASVABC$, $SM$, $SF$, $ETHBLACK$, $ETHHISP$, $MALE$, and $MALEASVC$, interpret the equation.

$\widehat{S_{Mi}}=9.99 + 0.17SM_i + 0.12SF_i + 0.53ETHBLACK_i + 0.19ETHHISP_i+ 1.17ASVABC_i$

We find a lower intercept for the male sample, meaning that if all independent variables for our male and female sample were zero, then men would have 0.78987 years less education than women. This difference is highly statistically significant.

While we find the slope-coefficient of the ability score to be lower for men than for women, this difference is not statistically significant at the 5\% or even 10\% significance level.
